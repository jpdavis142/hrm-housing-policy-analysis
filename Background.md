# Housing Supply and Affordability in Halifax: Background on Emerging Policy Choices
The Halifax Regional Municipality is at a critical juncture in addressing its escalating housing affordability crisis. Between 2023 and 2024, Halifax’s population increased by 11,600 residents to 503,037, yet only 4,691 new housing units were completed during the same period, resulting in a persistent supply shortfall with an estimated gap of over 17,500 homes in 2024. In an environment where demand far outstrips supply, average rents for two-bedroom apartments reached $1,707 per month, representing a 68 percent increase since 2015 and far exceeding provincial rent controls. Meanwhile, the homeless population nearly tripled between 2024 and 2025, rising from 1,132 to 3,295 individuals. These indicators underscore why the policy decision regarding implementation of a vacant property tax versus direct investment in affordable housing matters. The outcome will significantly shape housing access, affordability, and citywide socioeconomic stability.

The stakes in this decision are substantial. Halifax’s rental vacancy rate improved modestly from historic lows of 1.0 percent to 2.1 percent in 2024 but remains below long-term averages, indicating ongoing market tightness. Without effective policy intervention, the housing gap is projected to widen further to approximately 31,000 units by 2027, increasing pressure on low-income households and exacerbating homelessness. In this context, choosing an ineffective strategy could prolong market dysfunction and perpetuate adverse outcomes for vulnerable residents.

This decision is inherently complex due to competing policy mechanisms and tradeoffs. One option under consideration is a vacant property tax modeled on programs adopted in Vancouver and Toronto. Vancouver’s Empty Homes Tax, first introduced at 1 percent of assessed value and later increased to 3 percent, was associated with a 36 percent reduction in empty units between 2017 and 2021 and generated over $115 million for housing initiatives. However, Toronto’s version has faced administrative challenges, including errors affecting thousands of property declarations in 2024 and questions about its impact given a low vacancy base. Advocates argue that such a tax could incentivize owners to lease unused units and expand effective supply, while critics raise concerns about enforcement complexity and uncertain effects in markets with structural supply constraints.

The alternative policy of direct municipal investment in affordable housing construction offers targeted supply creation but comes with its own set of obstacles. High interest rates, labour shortages, and sharply increased land costs, with prices rising from approximately $60,000 to $200,000 per plot, have slowed development and raised capital requirements. Additionally, construction timelines mean that new units may not address immediate housing needs.

A range of stakeholders has vested interests in the outcome of this decision. Low-income renters and individuals experiencing homelessness are directly affected by affordability pressures and availability constraints. Property owners and landlords would face new tax obligations and compliance requirements under a vacant property tax regime. Real estate developers could benefit from increased municipal investment but may also experience market disruption from the introduction of newly available units. Municipal taxpayers would ultimately fund housing initiatives either through tax revenues or direct investment, and local businesses rely on stable housing to attract and retain employees.

Currently, Halifax’s strategy emphasizes supply-side reforms. In mid-2024, the municipality implemented planning amendments to permit up to four units on virtually any residential lot within serviced urban areas and up to eight units on larger lots in central neighborhoods, supported by participation in the federal Housing Accelerator Fund. However, Halifax has not yet adopted a vacant property tax, focusing instead on enabling new construction while underutilized units remain vacant even as some landlords offer incentives such as free rent to attract tenants. 


## Key Stakeholders:
1. Low-income renters
* Households already facing affordability pressures who are most vulnerable to rent increases and limited housing availability.
